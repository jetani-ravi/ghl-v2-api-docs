## Gohighlevel v2 API Documentation

This repository contains the API documentation for Gohighlevel v2, built using OpenAPI 3.0.0 and hosted with Stoplight. 

### Understanding the Documentation

This documentation leverages two key technologies:

* **OpenAPI 3.0.0 (OAS3):**  A widely adopted standard for describing APIs. It uses a machine-readable format (YAML or JSON) to define endpoints, data models, security mechanisms, and more.
* **Stoplight:** An interactive platform for visualizing and consuming OpenAPI specifications. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore the API, test requests, and understand functionalities.

This documentation utilizes Stoplight to present the Gohighlevel API in a clear and interactive manner.
